# Palmer-Penguins-Descriptive-Statistics-Hypothesis-Testing-Python-
Statistical analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset to compare penguin morphology across species and islands, test group differences, and measure relationships between key variables.
## Project Goals
- Clean scientific data (missing values, inconsistent entries)
- Produce descriptive statistics by species and island
- Test distribution assumptions (normality)
- Run hypothesis tests (ANOVA, t-test) and report effect sizes
- Analyze relationships (correlation: flipper length vs body mass)
- Visualize distributions and group differences

## Dataset
- Palmer Penguins dataset (Dr. Kristen Gorman, Palmer Station, Antarctica)
